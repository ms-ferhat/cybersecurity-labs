- `10.1.9.101` like to be comprmsied machine ip
- `10.1.9.1` like to be router ip
- `45.126.209.4` like to be C2 server ip, ensure after ckeck virustotal

**The attacker successfully executed a command to download the first stage of the malware. What is the URL from which the first malware stage was installed?**

```

**Which hosting provider owns the associated IP address?**

look for ip address lookup for C2 ip.

**By analyzing the malicious scripts, two payloads were identified: a loader and a secondary executable. What is the SHA256 of the malware executable?**

if you look on virustotal about the file relate to C2 server, will see malware.exe file and sha256 is match required.
